# Textbook Database

## Introduction

Students are painfully aware of how expensive new textbooks are.  We decided to build a program that would collect books' data and let people put their old books up for sale.

## Features

We have the following features:

* Search by course number: Find books that match a specific course number.
* Search by book title: Find books containing a search string.
* Search by ISBN: Find books by their ISBN.
* List departments: Lists all departments in the database.
* Search by department: Search for books in a given department.
* Add a book: add a book to the database.
* Quit: exit the program.

## Not yet implemented

* Allow users to find their books and mark a particular book as sold.

## Known bugs

* none
